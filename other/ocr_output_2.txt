EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

o accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on safe sanitation, the
T Prime Minister of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October 2014. Swachh Bharat Mission
aims to achieve Swachh Bharat by 2019, as a fitting tribute to the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi,
which in rural areas shall mean improving the levels of cleanliness in rural areas through Solid and Liquid Waste
Management activities and making Gram Panchayats Open Defecation Free (ODF), clean and sanitized. ODF
would mean the termination of feco-oral transmission, defined by, a) no visible feces found in the
environment/village and, b) every household as well as public/community institution(s) using safe technology
option for disposal of feces. The World Bank is supporting the Government of India’s initiative of ‘Swachh Bharat
Mission Support Operation’ which comprised of two categories of activities: Performance incentives for
sanitation improvement in rural areas;

Technical Assistance for strengthening institutional capacities on program management, advocacy, and
communications, and implementing a credible and robust monitoring & evaluation system to measure results of
SBM-G.

To execute the activities, World Bank decided to reward the performance of states basis of achieving key
sanitation outcomes which were measured through four disbursement linked indicators1

DLI #1: Reduction in the prevalence of Open Defecation

DLI #2: Sustaining ODF Status in villages

DLI #3: Increase in population with access to Solid & Liquid Waste Management
DLI #4: Operationalization of Performance Incentive Grant Scheme by MDWS

PwWwNrR

Aligned with the requirement of the programme, the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation selected M/s IPE
Global in association with Hindustan Thompson Associates Private Limited, represented by KANTAR PUBLIC (A
specialist unit of HTA Pvt Itd /IMRB International division) as an Independent Verification Agency (IVA) to conduct
National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) for measuring the performance of each state with respect to
the above mentioned DLIs.

The report is based on The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS)- Round-2 (2017-18) which was
conducted between November 2018 to February 2019. The primary objective of the survey was to measure the
Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in the Round-2 against the baseline which was already in place after NARSS
Round-1 survey. The NARSS Round-2 DLI report is intended to work as a reference point for the World Bank
project support to the Swacch Bharat Mission (Gramin).

The survey components included sampled household survey and village survey which gathered information on
various aspects of the sanitation related indicators under the purview of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs).
These indicators were primarily focusing on (i) DLI#1: Reduction in the prevalence of Open Defecation (ii) DLI#1:
Sustaining ODF status in villages, and (iii) DLI#3: Increase in population with Solid Liquid Waste Management
practices. The village component of the survey was designed to capture the data pertaining to the sanitation
aspect of the Schools, Anganwadi Centers, Public Toilets and Public Spaces. The entire survey process, from the
questionnaire design to field work and quality check was supervised by the Expert Working Group (EWG), under
the chairmanship of Prof. Amitabh Kundu and co-chairmanship of Dr. NC Saxena. The EWG included
representatives of the World Bank, UNICEF, Water Aid, BMGF, NSSO and India Sanitation Coalition among others.

The NARSS survey covered rural areas of 29 states and 3 Union Territories, with total proposed sample size of
92040 households as per the calculated sample size required by the study, proportionately distributed across
6136 villages. The sample framework was approved by the Expert Working Group set up to guide and steer the
National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey. Altogether 6136 villages and 92411 Households were covered.

The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) was designed to verify the sanitation related indicators
which primarily focuses on availability and access to the safe, hygienic and functional sanitation facilities and
solid and liquid waste (SLWM) management practices. The main objectives of the NARSS are as under:
a) Tocollect data on availability, accessibility, cleanliness/ hygiene, functionality and usage of the toilets of
the household and public institutions.
b) To verify the actual sanitation coverage in rural areas in terms of availability and accessibility of toilets.
c) To verify access to the safe, hygienic and functional status of sanitation facilities.
d) To gather information on safe waste disposal practices across ODF and Non-ODF categories of the
villages.
e) To measure the community managed sanitation systems focusing on scientific solid and liquid waste
management systems for overall cleanliness in rural areas.
f) To gather information on instances of open defecation in public places and solid and liquid waste disposal
mechanism in the village.

NARSS SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

NARSS survey is a cross-sectional survey and covers ODF and Non-ODF rural areas across 29 states & 3 UTs in
India. This report is based on the information gathered from 92411 households, 6002 schools, 6082 Anganwadi
Centres, 1091 Public toilets and 6136 Public spaces from 6136 PSUs. Two types of sampled villages- ODF verified
and Non-ODF (including ODF declared but not verified) were covered in the survey. The sample size for each
state is statistically significant and is proportionate to the total rural households in that state/ UT. Within each
state/ UT, the sample size is statistically significant for ODF verified and non-ODF categories and is proportionate
to the total rural households in ODF verified and non-ODF villages in that state/ UT. MIS data from MDWS with
cut-off date of 6th June 2018, as approved by the EWG, was used to determine the proportion of rural population
living in ODF and Non-ODF areas in each state/ UT.

About 200 households were listed in each village (over 12 lakhs households across the country). A total of 20
households (15 targeted + 5 additional HHs as a replacement) were selected systematically from each of the PSU.
The total number for selection of households for main interview was revised in consultation with MDWS
(Meeting on 27th January 2019) in the mid-way of data collection which also includes the selection of 24
household including 20% buffer basis the size of the PSUs wherein the total households in the village is more
than 750. Out of 24 households, 20 households were canvassed for main interview while remaining 4 HHs were
put as substitute.) Selection of different number of households as per the size of the village will help in comparing
the key sanitation indicators and also to make the sample more representative of the universe.

Along with households, the village components like Schools, Anganwadi, Public/ Community Toilets and Public
spaces were also selected using systematic random sampling in the same village for the survey. The sampling
design undertaken in this survey yields results within a 95% confidence interval and within 5% of margin of error.
The sampling methodology used was Probability Proportion to Size (PPS). This report provides the detailed
description of survey findings pertaining to key areas of interest for rural sanitation. The survey specifically
covered the verification of toilet accessibility to the safe, functional, hygienic sanitation facilities by the
households and village level public facilities.

QUALITY CONTROL
Several quality control measures were put in place to ensure that uniform procedures across the states and UTs
are preserved. These included:

e Preparing comprehensive manuals including Interviewer’s manual & Supervisor’s manual.

e Multiple levels of monitoring and supervisions of the field work including monitoring by the supervisors,
state coordinators from the Kantar Public; monitoring by senior staff from the state offices of the Kantar
Public; field monitoring by core team members of the Kantar Public, in addition to monitoring of field
activities by senior members of MDWS and representatives of The World Bank. Immediate corrective
measures were taken in case there were any deviations from the survey protocols.

e The field supervisors in each interviewing team were required to observe interviews in a sub-sample of
households and to conduct back-checks with respondents as a further check on the quality of field work.

e Use of computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and the transfer of field data to the server on a
daily basis was instrumental in remotely monitoring of progress of field activities. Use of dashboard data
to run the extensive data quality checks of the data and to provide real-time feedback to field teams to
help improve data quality.

e To ensure uniformity in the implementation of the field work protocols in every state, a training of
trainers was conducted at MDWS. The core team members and state coordinators of Kantar Public
participated in the TOT. These trained persons were responsible for organizing state level training
programmes in local and regional languages for minimum three days including one day’s field practice
which were supervised by the senior members of the MDWS, a representative of the World Bank and
core team members of Kantar Public & IPE Global.

e Field check tables were produced on a regular basis to identify any inconsistency that might have
occurred in eliciting information and recording question responses. Information from the field check

tables was fed back to state coordinators so that corrective actions could be taken immediately, and
performance of the teams could be improved.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF DLI

SBM (G) performance of the states was measured through their performance on the disbursement linked
indicators (DLIs) through the NARSS Round-1 survey which intended to provide the baseline values. The
performance of DLI helped in setting benchmark for the distribution of financial incentives to states, which was
directly proportional to the actual DLI performance of the states. The different DLIs were calculated basis the set
of robust parameters agreed in the NARSS protocol and approved by EWG, and even if any of the prescribed
criteria for qualifying the ODFness were not followed, the villages were declared as non-ODF. The detailed
description of DLI and its calculation process has been given in separate chapter. The State-wise performance of
the states against the DLIs is as below:

LESSON LEARNED & WAY FORWARD ON NARSS
Over the period of operationalization of NARSS Round-1, some important lessons were learnt which helped
improve the NARSS Round 2. Key lessons learnt include:

Improving introduction to the Survey: The surveyors were found to be referring SBM while giving
introduction to the survey respondent. By taking note of this when it was found that reference of SBM
during introduction may dilute the effect of NARSS as being independent survey, the word SBM was
struck off.

e While listing exercise, the household recorded locked were decided to be revisited before final
submission into the CAPI. This broadened the sample frame up-to some extent and made the household
sample through SRS more representative.

e Segmentation of village with more than 200 households, the operational protocol guided that the main
segment of the village will automatically be selected, and the second segment will be selected as per
randomization. The protocol revisited by the researcher and corrected in a way that could make the
segmentation and selection only on random basis.

e Likewise, for the village level public facility interview, the initial guideline was to conduct interview in the
higher facility eg. School with higher level of education or Anganwadi centre catering services to the
higher population. It was later noted that the selection of facility (School, AWC & Public toilet) for
conducting interview should be through random selection only which provides more representativeness
to the available facility in the sampled village.

e Probing techniques in accessibility questions of household and village level survey questionnaire were

improved when it was observed that there is a scope of improvement. Sometimes, the respondent made-

out of the question posed to them that the interviewers are enquiring about availability of the toilet
which was not the case whatsoever.

Interviewers started using probing methods as to which types of toilet technology was used.

Several insights and learnings have emerged out of the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey which should
emerge as the priority actions for the Ministry for future years. The key lessons emerging out of NARSS include
focussing IEC interventions on safe disposal of human excreta in villages, prioritising solid and liquid waste
management arrangements in villages, retrofitting of toilets for ensuring safe disposal of human excreta etc.
MDWS would have to develop interventions and monitor its implementation so that these areas are addressed.

Summary of the lesson learnt from NARSS Round-1 & discussion took place between IVA and MDWS
The followings key points were taken into consideration at the time of data collection, which were emphasized
by the MDWS while discussing the quality assurance aspect of the survey.

e While canvassing the accessibility questions of the household module, probing techniques were
adopted. The idea was if the respondents were unable to comprehend the questions, the probing helped
them understand the accessibility questions properly.

e Before interviewing the respondent, a walk around the household premises if feasible is necessary, so
that nothing could be missed out while recording the responses.

e  Ensured in-depth understanding of all aspect of questionnaire. Background of each sanitation related
indicators were understood by the field teams.
e In few instances, it was observed that in response to the questions of accessibility of toilet, the
respondent shown the shared toilet while they have had their own toilet which was under construction.
The provision of capturing of toilet photographs added after interviewing functionality part of the
questionnaire.

CHAPTER-1: INTRODUCTION

1.1. |©_BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

Prime Minister of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2™ October 2014. Swachh Bharat Mission
aims to achieve Swachh Bharat by 2019, as a fitting tribute to the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi,
which in rural areas shall mean improving the levels of cleanliness in rural areas through Solid and Liquid Waste

T o accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on safe sanitation, the

Management activities and making Gram Panchayats Open Defecation Free (ODF) clean and sanitized. ODF
would mean the termination of faeco-oral transmission, defined by, a) no visible faeces found in the
environment/village and b) every household as well as public/community institution(s) using safe technology
option for disposal of faeces.

India through the launch of Swacch Bharat Mission (SBM) has created that rare window of opportunity that could
improve the quality of life for its 1.2 billion citizens and lay the foundations for a truly prosperous future—a future
that will impact the country and its people for generations to come. The Hon’ble Prime Minister, in his
Independence Day speech on 15 August 2014, espoused the need for a clean India. He called for Swachh Bharat,
a massive mass movement that seeks to engage everyone in the task of cleaning homes, work places, villages,
cities and surroundings, in a collective quest.

The Strategy was to move towards a ‘Swachh Bharat’ by making it a massive mass movement that seeks to
engage everyone in the task of cleaning homes, work places, villages, cities and surroundings, in a collective
quest. The focus has been to provide flexibility to State governments, as sanitation is a State subject, to decide
on their implementation policy, use of funds and mechanisms, considering the state specific requirements. This
was to enable States to develop an Implementation Framework that can utilize the provisions under the Mission
effectively and maximize the impact of the interventions. The Government of India’s role is to complement the
efforts of the State governments through the focused programme being given the status of a Mission, recognizing
its dire need for the country.

Behaviour change has been the key differentiator of Swachh Bharat Mission and therefore emphasis is placed
on Behaviour Change Communication (BCC). BCC is not a 'stand-alone' separate activity to be done as a
‘component’ of SBM-G, but about mobilizing and nudging communities into adopting safe and sustainable
sanitation practices through effective BCC. The approach was to adopt Community Approaches to Sanitation
(CAS) focusing heavily on triggering entire communities and on achieving collective behavioural change.
Emphasis was placed on awareness generation, triggering mindsets leading to community behaviour change and
demand generation for sanitary facilities in houses, schools, Anganwadis, places of community congregation, and
for Solid and Liquid Waste Management activities. Since Open Defecation Free villages cannot be achieved
without all the households and individuals conforming to the desired behaviour of toilet use every day and every
time, community action and generation of social norms are key.

Swacch Bharat Mission is at a unique juncture where historic changes related to collective behaviour change and
improving the practice of defecation unfolded in lakhs of villages across States. A number of India’s states took

CHAPTER-1: INTRODUCTION acess

pioneering bold new initiatives to tackle the menace of open defecation, many of sector’s long-standing
challenges and are making great strides towards collective and sustainable sanitation and hygiene outcomes.
1.2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF NARSS

The World Bank is supporting the Government of India’s initiative of ‘Swachh Bharat Mission Operation’ which
comprised of two categories of activities:

a) Performance incentives for sanitation improvement in rural areas;

b) Technical Assistance for strengthening institutional capacities on program management, advocacy, and
communications, and implementing a credible and robust monitoring & evaluation system to measure
results of SBM-G.

To execute the activities, the Government of India, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the World Bank
agreed for the World Bank support on SBMSO, to reward the performance of states basis of achieving key
sanitation outcomes which were measured through four disbursement linked indicators”

1. DLI #1: Reduction in the prevalence of Open Defecation

2. DLI#2: Sustaining ODF Status in villages

3. DLI#3: Increase in population with access to Solid & Liquid Waste Management

4. DLI #4: Operationalization of Performance Incentive Grant Scheme by MDWS
Aligned with the requirement of the programme, the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation selected an
Independent Verification Agency (IVA) IPE Global in consortium with Kantar Public to conduct National Annual
Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) for measuring the performance of each state with respect to the above
mentioned DLIs.

As did NARSS Round-1, information on open defecation incidence, the levels of ODF status sustaining among the
villages which have already been verified as ODF and solid & liquid waste management related indicators were
generated that formed the basis for release of performance incentives to the states.

The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) was designed to verify the sanitation related indicators
which primarily focuses on availability and access to the safe, hygienic and functional sanitation facilities,
sustaining ODF status of the villages and improved solid and liquid waste (SLWM) management. The main
objectives of the NARSS are as under:
a. To collect data on availability, accessibility, cleanliness/ hygiene, functionality and usage of the
toilets of the household and public institutions.
b. To verify the actual sanitation coverage in rural areas in terms of availability, accessibility and
usage of toilets.
c. To gather information on safe waste disposal practices across ODF and Non-ODF categories of
the villages.
d. To measure the community managed sanitation systems focussing on scientific solid and liquid
waste management systems for overall cleanliness in rural areas.
e. To gather information on instances of open defecation in public places and solid and liquid waste
disposal mechanism in the village.

Geographically, the survey was conducted in the rural areas of 29 Indian states and 3 Union Territories (UTs).
The total sample size targeted at the national level was 92040 HHs as per the calculated sample size required
for the survey, proportionately distributed across 6,136 villages (Primary Sampling Units). Details of state wise
sample allocation have been given in the subsequent chapter.

1.3. APPROACH TO THE SURVEY
As did National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey, Round-1 (done by the Independent Verification Agency or IVA),

the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey, Round-2 was expected to provide the estimates for the key
indicators to measure progress on DLIs and other key results. It has provided the progress against baseline on

CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY & APPROACH

2.1. | SURVEY DESIGN

he annual rounds of the NARSS is a cross sectional survey. NARSS 2 was conducted between November
2018 to February 2019. Different components of NARSS are pictorially described below:

NARSS Survey

ODF Verified Villages Non ODF Villages

Household Listing Household Survey Village Survey

In the village categories (ODF villages and non-ODF villages), besides toilet access, functionality, hygienic
condition, usage, safe disposal of excreta and information on safe disposal mechanisms of solid and liquid waste
management at the village/ household level was collected through CAPI| (Computer Assisted Personal Interview)
platform.

2.2. TARGET RESPONDENTS
Listing: The key respondents for the listing exercise were any adult member of the household (aged more than
18 years) who provided basic information with respect to the head of the household & other information.

Household Survey: The key respondents for the household survey were an adult member of the household (aged
more than 18 years) who provided comprehensive information with respect to the household level sanitation
practices. However, the teams tried to conduct the household level interviews with the head of the household
and other members whoever was available during the survey. The other members of the household were
interviewed only for usage of the toilet.

Village Survey: The key respondents were school headmaster/ head teacher, the Anganwadi Worker (AWW)/
Helper and/ or the key officials such as Sarpanch/ Gram Panchayat (GP) secretary or other prominent people in
the village.

2.3. SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Sampling frame of NARSS covers all the 29 States and 3 Union Territories (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra
and Nagar Haveli and Puducherry). In Round-2, total sample size at the national level was 6,136 villages covering
92,040 households comprised of two sample streams viz., ODF (verified) and non-ODF (including ODF declared
but not verified). A three-stage sampling procedure was adopted to select sample households across the states
where villages were primary sampling units (PSUs).

Stage 1: Allocation of samples in the states/UTs
As a first step, total study target sample size (92,040 HHs) has been allocated to each state/UT based on the

proportion of rural household of the state and UT as per IMIS data received from NIC & MDWS with the cut-off
date considered as 6'" June 2018.

The state wise sample was further adjusted to ensure allocation of minimum sample size to each state/UT to
keep margin of error within 5 percent.

As a next step within the selected village, the one which were having less than or equal to 200 household,
complete listing of the village was carried out and a total number of 18 households got selected following
systematic random sampling procedure including 20% buffer, out of which first 15 households were canvassed
subject to the availability of reliable informant in those households and remaining 3 households were used as a
substitute sample if necessary. The selection criteria of the household revised in consultation with client (MDWS
& World Bank) and that the selection of 20 households (15 targeted + 5 additional HHs as a replacement) were
done for the PSUs with less than 750 HHs while 24 households were sampled including 20% buffer in the PSUs
which were having more than 750 households. Out of 24 HHs, 20 households were surveyed and remaining 4
households were used as substitute. The discussion of revision of selection criteria of household was held on 27"
January 2019 at Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation.

Those villages wherein more than 200 households were found, were segmented and 2 segments were eventually
selected randomly for house-listing exercise.

The below table provides the detail of final adjusted villages and sample HHs covered in each study state/UT.
Below table provides sample distribution in proportionate to the state population post adjustment of minimum
sample size for desired statistical sample requirement at state level.

* States/UTs wherein adjustment was done for minimum sample coverage requirement considering within 5% margin of
error.

Stage 2: Village Selection

As a second step, allocated samples to each state/UT (as shown in table-2 above) has been further
proportionately distributed between ODF verified and Non-ODF villages within state/UT based on proportion of
ODF verified HHs and Non-ODF HHs. MIS data received from NIC of MDWS (as on 6*" June 2018) (this date is a
cut-off date for the extraction of data) has been utilized for allocation of samples between ODF and Non-ODF
components. The below table provide distribution of villages between ODF and Non-ODF villages within state.
Considering that study has been designed to provide a statistically significant estimate for ODF and Non-ODF
separately at 95 % confidence interval (Cl) and 5% margin of error (MOE), we have further adjusted samples
between ODF and Non-ODF category in states with MOE found to be greater than 5%. The states wherein either
ODF villages or Non-ODF villages were found in the sample frame. The sample was drawn from their respective
village category.

Necessary adjustment has been made to sampling methodology to ensure State-wise margin of error to be less
than 5%. This was done by increasing the number of villages for few States, which had higher MoE. In some of
the large states, ODF verified HH proportion was quite less, hence an adjustment is done in order to keep margin
of errors below five percent in sub-samples. The states coming under category are ANI, Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra

& Nagar Haveli, Goa, J&K, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry & Sikkim. For rest of the states
no adjustment is necessary to contain the margin of error within the limit of five percent for both the sub-
samples. However, for those smaller States where total rural HH population for the whole universe is less (both
verified and Non ODF) it is almost impossible to maintain margin of error below 5 in sub samples. Therefore, for
these small states margin of error was maintained at the overall level only. This sampling methodology is
consistent to the general approach adopted for large scale surveys such as NSSOs. In Round-2, each state had
sufficient number of ODF PSUs in sample frame to get the desired number of ODF PSUs in each state.

Process of village selection: The process of village selection has been explained below for ODF and Non-ODF
categories separately.

a) ODF villages
The following was the key steps involved in the sampling methodology for the sub-component 1 i.e. ‘ODF verified
village’:

CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH PPaceas |


--- Page 22 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

1. Generation of the sampling frame based on the list of the ODF verified villages as per IMIS data by each
of the selected state/UT.

2. Selection of the required ODF verified villages (refer Table-2) through the PPS (Probability Proportion to
Size) sampling technique:

Steps involved in PPS sampling

1. Arranging of the state-wise list of ODF villages in the ascending order of village HHs (after excluding the
villages having less than 50 HHs) and calculating the cumulative sum of the HH sizes

2. Computing a sampling interval (SI) by dividing the cumulative HHs with the total number of ODF verified
villages to be sampled in the state

3. Choosing a random number between 1 and the sampling interval from a random table. This would serve
as the Random start (RS) or in other words, is the first selected village

4. Next, the SI is added to the RS to identify the second selected village. In a similar manner, the SI gets
added to each of the previous number to identify the villages till the required number of villages are
selected.

b) Non ODF villages and Non-verified ODF villages
The following were the key steps involved in the sampling methodology for the sub-component 2 i.e. Non-ODF
village (i.e. any village which is not verified ODF and not declared):
1. Generation of the sampling frame based on the list of the Non-ODF villages as per IMIS data by each of
the selected state/UT
2. Selection of the required non-ODF villages (refer Table-2) through the PPS (Probability Proportion to Size)
sampling technique.
3. In NARSS Year-1, we had approximately 70% of the total sample in non-ODF category, hence, in order to
ensure the geographical representation; an additional sampling stage (NSS region) was included while in
NARSS Year-2, approximately 50 % of the total sample lying in ODF verified and non-ODF categories,
hence, direct PPS sampling technique was applied to achieve the required samples in the states as we
applied in sample selection of ODF verified category.

Stage 3: Household selection

Mapping and listing: In each of the selected villages (ODF and Non-ODF), team members were given the number
of households of the PSUs as per IMIS 2018 as a reference with cut-off date of 6" June 2018. In case, the number
of estimated HHs were less than the household number given in IMIS data, lister probed the key informants to
ensure that all the hamlets of the sampled villages were included while estimating the total number of HHs in
the villages. If still deviation persisted, then lister further confirmed the number with other key informants to
doubly ensure prior to initiating the listing exercise. It preceded the process of HH selection for the main
interviews.

After completion of listing exercise, the data submitted by pressing Submit button. The CAPI then threw 18
sampled HHs selected through systematic random selection Only 15 HHs were interviewed while 3 HHs were
kept as replacement. In later stage of the survey, the EWG proposed to to exceed the selection of household to
20 (15 HHs were interviewed in main survey while 5 HHs were kept for replacement) (Discussion held on 27" Jan

CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH PPaceze |


--- Page 23 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

2019). 24 households (15 HHs were interviewed in main survey while 5 HHs were kept for replacement) were
selected in those PSUs wherein the total number of HHs were more than 750.

Segmentation of village (before listing exercise)
Since village size varies considerably within each state and to have uniformity in operational/implementation

of data collection, segmentation exercise was used. In current survey, if sample villages had less than or equal
to 200 households, a complete household listing was done. The process of segmentation was carried out only
in the large PSUs i.e. in the ones which had more than 200 households.

As a part of the HH listing, the team listed out and mapped all types of settlement in the identified villages to
completely cover the village geographically (main village/ hamlets/ satellite settlements etc.) and socially
(clusters of HHs by different caste, tribe etc). The process of segmentation has been described below:

Village segmentation process

Village Households Number & Selection of Hamlets
Category

Households less than or up to 200 1 (Full PSU to be covered)

Segmentation done with each segment having
Households from 201 to 2000 approximately 100 households. 2 segments to
be selected randomly through CAPI
The village segregated into 4 parts equally
(Quartile approach) considering the number of
households residing in all the natural segments
One such segment/part was further selected
randomly through CAPI
Finally, the selected segment was considered as
the village for further segmentation as
described in category #2 village

Households above 2000

It is important to note that approximately equal segments of 100 households were created for all the villages
wherever segmentation was required. However, creating an equal segment of 100 HHs was not possible always
in a field setting. Hence, a minimum of 180 to 200 HHs were listed for those villages where equal segment of 100
HHs could not be created.

While doing sampling by PPS technique, there were high probabilities that most of the large villages get sampled.
For the villages which had more than 2000 HHs, a quartile approach was used, since undertaking a segmentation
exercise was a cumbersome process as key informant had little awareness about all the settlements in a such
large village. Villages having more than 2000 HHs were divided into four quartiles (each quartile had almost an
equal number of the HHs) and one quartile was selected randomly for the survey for undertaking further
segmentation as explained above.

CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH



--- Page 24 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Step 1: Sample Frame Development in the sampled villages (Listing)

¢ Detailed map of village was drawn to show different segment within the village, before interviewer started

listing of households.

e In each of the selected villages (ODF and Non ODF), a detailed listing of the households has been carried
out by using CAPI to generate the sample frame for the household selection for HH interviews.

e During this exercise, the team collected only the name of the Head of the HHLD and address/Landmark of
the HHLD.

Selection of Households:

Post completion of listing exercise in a village by using CAPI, the application did random selection and provided
a serial number to the selected households. A total of 20 households (15 targeted + 5 additional HHs as a
replacement) were selected systematically from each of the PSU.

(The total number for selection of households for main interview was revised in consultation with MDWS
(Meeting on 27" January 2019) in the mid-way of data collection which also includes the selection of 24
household including 20% buffer basis the size of the PSUs wherein the total households in the village is more than
750. Out of 24 households, 20 households were canvassed for main interview while remaining 4 HHs were put as
substitute.) Selection of different number of households as per the size of the village will help in comparing the
key sanitation indicators and to make the sample more representative of the universe.

Those villages wherein more than 200 households were found, were segmented and 2 segments were eventually
selected randomly for house-listing exercise.

The random selections of households were done using CAPI application.
Step 2: Household selection for Main survey

e After completion of listing exercise, the systematic random selection of households has been done by using
CAPI in each village.

e A total of 20 households (15 targeted + 5 additional HHs as a replacement) has been selected in each of the
village for the main survey.

e 24 households selected including 20% buffer basis the size of the PSUs wherein the total households in the

village is more than 750.
e HOUSEHOLD survey was conducted in the selected households from the listing exercise using CAPI

interviewing technique.

2.4. . COMPONENTS OF VILLAGE LEVEL SURVEYS

The village level survey was pertaining to identify the toilet access in public institutions and observe the
prevalence of open defecation in open spaces. Components of village level survey comprised of Government
School, Anganwadi Center, Public toilet (one from each village) and Public place. Observation of each component
was undertaken separately subject to availability in the villages. This component was conducted to ascertain
whether there was proper usage and safe confinement of excreta in accordance to the ODF definition and
according to guidelines.

2.5. SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES

Six survey questionnaires (Household listing Questionnaire, Household Questionnaire, Anganwadi
Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Public/Community toilet Questionnaire and Public spaces sanitation
Questionnaire) were canvassed in 10 local languages (English, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam,
Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Odiya and Assamese) for different regions/states using Computer Assisted Personal
Interviewing (CAPI).

NARSS primarily focused on access, functionality and usage of toilet by the individual (Household & Public
facilities both) besides verifying the solid & liquid waste management practices. Head of the household or any
other household member eligible to participate in the survey has been interviewed for administering household
schedule. Family roster was used to enlist the usual members of the family and each member’s defecation
practices were recorded at appropriate places of the questionnaire. Besides interviewing head of the household
or any other eligible member of the household, all eligible household members were interviewed, wherever
possible, for the usage pattern of household toilet. Village level schedules were also administered to observe the
different set of sanitation related parameters covering AWC, school, public toilet and public space sanitation.
Geo-tagged pictures of the facilities observed were also captured. The details of survey tools have been described
below:

CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH Paces |

J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

1. HH listing schedule: Information required to produce the sampling-frame, found after identifying
available households through listing exercise to select households from the selected village.

2. HH survey schedule: This schedule collected information on self-reported HH level sanitation
arrangements, defecation practices of each usual resident, availability and safety of sanitation facilities
accessible to the household, and associated practices e.g. handling/ disposal of child faeces less than 3
years old, wherever applicable.

3. Anganwadi schedule: This schedule collected information on availability, accessibility to the toilet,
functionality, hygiene, usage and practices adopted for disposal of human excreta.

4. School schedule: This schedule collected information mainly on availability of the school toilets,
accessibility to the toilet, functionality, hygiene, usage, hand- washing and practices adopted for disposal
of human excreta.

5. Public/ Community Toilet schedule: This schedule collected information on availability, functionality,
usage, availability of water and practices adopted for disposal of human excreta and user fee charged.

6. Public spaces sanitation schedule: This schedule collected information on any visible signs of open
defecation and visible accumulated solid/liquid waste; and availability of OD incidences.

2.6. © TRAINING MANUALS
Training manuals were developed to help interviewers understand the survey protocols and tools by describing

the technical aspects in pictorial way, wherever applicable. Two manuals were prepared, one for interviewers /
supervisors regarding guidelines to be followed for house listing and main surveys (household and village) and
second was for using CAPI (This was an operational manual for using CAPI application).

2.7. CAPI APPLICATION, SERVER AND SURVEY DASHBOARD

IVA’s IT team catered its services to all CAPI related aspects of NARSS which consisted of CAPI application
development, modifications in CAPI application after pre-test, server management and dashboard development.
Team also provided troubleshooting techniques and support during the entire data collection process. Translated
versions of questionnaires were used as interface by interviewers while conducting the interviews in CAPI. CAPI
also had provision of geo-tagging the sanitation facilities and capturing photographs wherever required as per
the survey schedule.

A dedicated server was used to store data in encrypted format. Limited user dashboard (password protected)
provided a real-time monitoring of the survey progress and status of key indicators. The server had two
important features (A) Status report for Main Survey and Back Check Survey on real time and (B) Visual form of
report for all 3 DLI indicators at different level i.e. State, district & ODF/Non-ODF.

Trainees were all the state coordinators and zonal coordinators who were subsequently responsible for giving
trainings to the state level field teams. These trainings were also attended by national team members for
uniformity in coordination. During this training, the participants were briefed about the technical and operational
components, interviewing skills and protocols of the NARSS. In the second phase, state level trainings were
conducted to train field interviewers and supervisors as per the manuals. On the last day of training, a mock test
was conducted among the trainees to assess the understanding of survey and its procedures. A test module was

CHAPTER-3: SAMPLE WEIGHTS ESTIMATION

3.1. SAMPLE WEIGHTS ESTIMATION

1. Objective of weightage calculation:

he basic objective of weighting sample data is appropriately assign weights to each surveyed household to
make estimates representative of the population of interest. When sample units have been selected with
differing probabilities, it is common to weight the results inversely proportional to the unit selection

probabilities, i.e., the design weight, to reflect the actual situation in the population.

2. Process:
In NARSS we have used “multiplier” approach for weighing purpose which is mostly used in large scale surveys.
In this approach, we arrive at multiplier for each stage of random sampling. During the sampling process, a three-
staged sampling methodology had been utilized as shown
below:

Stage 1: Selection of PSUs

Stage 2: Selection of segments within each PSU

Stage 3: Selection of household from each of the selected segments

Thus, the sampling weight was generated as products of inverse of probabilities of selection of units at each
stage. The following figure depicts the weighing process which was adopted in each level of sampling.

State Total ODF HHLD's (Sh)
Total Listed HHLD's (Lh) * No.of ODF PSU selected in state (Op)

PSU Multiplier (Pw) =

No. of segments in a PSU (Sp)

S t Multiplier (Sw) =

No.of Listed households in PSU (Hj)

Household Multiplier (Hhw) = No.of households interviewed (hj)

Aggregate multiplier (r) =

After calculation of aggregate multiplier (r) through multiple stages, the weights have been normalized through
using the following formula: -
Where,

r = Aggregate multiplier for each PSU

SS= State level sample size achieved

Z=Sum of weighted no. of interview Done

Weight Normalization

CHAPTER-4: EVOLUTION OF NARSS-2 FROM NARSS-1

4.1. IMPROVEMENTS IN NARSS 2 BASIS LEARNING FROM NARSS 1

F otowine major improvements were ensured in NARSS Round 2 basis learning from NARSS Round 1:

A. Introduction of the Survey

Using reference to SBM for introductions was seen to be leading to some bias in responses during interview. So,
it was agreed that the surveyors would do some general introduction about the purpose of the survey, rather
than referring to SBM.

Modification- Accordingly, the introduction was changed in the tool and script as well for NARSS Round 2. The
required changes were also incorporated in the training manual. The edited part of introduction used during
NARSS round 2 was as below:

Greetings!

My name is and | am working as an interviewer with Kantar Public, a leading research
organization. At present, we are conducting a survey to assess the sanitation behaviour of the population. We
wish to know about you, your family, and your village, and would like to spend about 15 minutes with you. We
are talking to several people in this and other villages. Talking to us or not is your decision.

During training, the surveyors were thoroughly trained not to refer to SBM, it was also done when mocks were
arranged.

B. Listing and Segmentation
a) Village Maps: Instructions were to prepare village maps on a white sheet, in consultation with the Gram
Pradhan. It was learnt that some peripheral cluster of Households (HHs)/habitations to the main village
could have been left out during the segmentation process in Round -1.

CHAPTER-4: EVOLUTION OF NARSS-2 FROM NARSS-1 Paces: |


--- Page 32 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Modification - An individual sheet for framing the lay out map of the village was used to draw in a separate white
sheet. The map included all the hamlets (falling in the village) as it is located along with natural boundary. After
that artificial segmentation was done as per given criteria with the help of key informants of the village. (Drawing
of map with the help of google earth seemed not feasible for segmentation since the size for segments could not
be assessed while a natural boundary may be determined, hence the map was made manually by each team in
the village.)

b) Segmentation: Segmentation of the village with > 200 households must be done randomly as per the
protocol, selected by the CAPI. Numbering shall follow from top left or NE and clockwise. The manual
said differently that the main segment shall be necessarily selected. The manual has to be corrected, and
all instructions had to be given for random sampling of segments using CAPI.

Modification -The selections of segments which were covered in listing exercise, was automated by CAPI
program without the main segment being selected purposively. The information about the process of
segmentation has passed on to the field team not to make any bias based on caste and religion. The random
selection of segments was done by CAPI irrespective of geography of the village. Appropriate changes were made
in the manual explaining all the hamlets will have an equal chance of being selected.

Also, surveyors were trained/oriented that, during segmentation, they should take care not to do/refer about
religion/caste-based grouping of settlements.

C. Marking Households:

For differentiating households for Round-2, the convention NRD-2 (N- for NARSS, RD — for round, 2 for round 2)
was proposed.

Modification- A random starting point was taken to start the listing exercise and all the residential structures
within each locality/selected segment was assigned a unique number, starting from ‘001’. The numbers were
marked on the front wall/door of the structure by using a marker or chalks. A standard practice of marking the

CHAPTER-4: EVOLUTION OF NARSS-2 FROM NARSS-1 PPaceaz |


--- Page 33 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

structures during the listing exercise was emphasized & followed such as “NRD-2/001” for structure number
indicating an arrow towards the structure numbers are increasing.

The explanation on marking the structures were shared with all state teams and adhered in the due course of
data collection.

D. Using Buffer Households:

The buffer households were to be used — only as a replacement of non-available sampled households. However,
NARSS -1 data set showed many villages having more than 15 records and many villages had less than 15
records. This was addressed during training for NARSS-2 and during survey.

Modification- After selection of HH through CAPI, 1% 15 household was taken as original sample while rest 3 was
used as substitute sample to cover up the non-response rate. During the training, due emphasis had given in
each location in documenting the selection of HH. However, it was further discussed & proposed to take 5
additional household as buffer and final coverage was ensured to minimum 15 HHs in each selected PSU. Though
the suggestion of considering 5 buffers was added in later stage (almost in the verge of the completion of the
survey). The decision of 5 buffer households was taken by EWG to make replacement if the sampled households
were found locked during main survey.

E. Random selection of Schools/AWCs:

As per the Protocol, (see clause 6.3, page 13 of the Protocol). School/AWC shall be randomly selected. This was
not adhered in NARSS 1 while the public institutions were selected based on different criteria (highest grade of
school, population covered by AWC etc.)

Modification-The selection of AWC and schools was done through CAPI program. The selected School could be
either higher or lower educational level whichever is selected through random process while AWC was also
selected irrespective of population catered by the facility.

F. Public Toilets:

Differentiate between public toilets and cluster toilets, in round 1, in few villages, public toilet data reported
although there were no public toilets in these villages. This had come up because of inadequate clarity among
the surveyors to distinguish between Public & cluster toilet.

Modification- The difference between cluster & public toilet were briefed to all the state teams during training.
The following definition was further used in the survey and trained the surveyors consequently.

G. Row Toilet/ Cluster Toilet:
The toilets made for group of the HHs in any patch of the village will be considered as Row/ Cluster toilet while
these toilets are not to be considered as community/ Public toilet.

H. Addition of Supplementary questions:

NARSS 1 experienced some denial factors in response by the HH (denial of having toilets despite having one).
The four supplementary questions which was used as rider when the respondents say that they don’t have toilet.
In 6006 PSUs out of 6136, the supplementary questions were asked from household respondent.

CHAPTER-4: EVOLUTION OF NARSS-2 FROM NARSS-1 PPacess |


--- Page 34 ---

Modification- Four supplementary questions pertaining to the accessibility of the toilet facilities, was
incorporated in the CAPI and asked in case of respondent reported to have no access of toilet, however in few
villages, these questions could not be administered since the FW had already started.

|. Closed pit:

Picture of closed pit was not included in the training manual and good numbers of such response came out in
NARSS 1.

Modification- The picture of “closed pit” was incorporated in the manual and described the basic features of the
closed pit.

J. Survey process

Locked status- NARSS 1 experienced instances of lock of public institutions surveyed in few villages. This gave
the inadequate picture of over all out comes of NARSS due to exclusion of data came as non-response or invalid.
Action: While surveying, if the institutional/School/Public toilets were locked, the surveyors made all attempts
to revisit again to complete the survey when they were open.

Solid Waste Disposal System- The surveyors were trained to correlate the responses from the HH’s regarding
SW disposal, to check whether there is a system existing in the village/segment for common collection and
disposal mechanism.

Female Surveyors- Deployment of adequate female surveyors in the survey, subject to taking care of issues like
safety, security to them, and practicality of survey implementation. Total 14.4 percent of female investigators
were deployed in the field across the states.

Action: Due effort was given to deploy the female investigators subject to safety measures and operational
feasibility.

Training Evaluation- One-pager evaluation paper for the trainees was used to measure the understanding of
survey aspects. This had included issues pertaining to survey like segmentation, listing issues, etc., and to test
the surveyors’ understanding.

CHAPTER-5: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS

5.1. QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS

check, an Expert Working Group (EWG) was constituted under the chairmanship of Prof. Amitabh Kundu
and Co-chairmanship of Dr. NC Saxena. The EWG included representatives of the World Bank, UNICEF, Water
Aid, BMGF, NSSO and representative of Niti Aayog, and India Sanitation Coalition among others. Quality
assurance steps were taken at each stage of survey to ensure high-quality data generation.

T: oversee and support the entire NARSS process, from the questionnaire design to field work and quality

Participation in Training by EWG & MDWS: To strengthen the survey process and monitoring the state level
training, the member of EWG and MDWS participated in training of interviewers and supervisors and visited
teams during the field practice. These visits were aimed to ensure that the protocols laid out for NARSS Round-
2 being followed while training the field teams. Multiple visits at the field during data collection and back- checks
across the states were also made by the MDWS and EWG members and an emphasis were put in place that the
survey teams who imparted in standardized state level training, adhering to the protocols and exhibit the highest
level of integrity and professionalism while being at the field.

Quality control mechanism at IVA: To ensure quality assurance over the overall survey process and to ensure
continuous feedback, a detailed quality control and feedback mechanism had been designed at the level of IVA.
This ensured collection of good quality data. IVA created mechanisms to track the surveyors visit to the field and
provided evidence to MDWS on key aspects like time taken in completion of the survey, geo-tagging of locations
and pictures. All the interviews had a start time and end time along with the length of the interviews. The quality
control included quality check mechanisms at following stages:

a. __ Inputs Stage
b. Data collection Stage
c. Data validation Stage

The quality checks were performed over all the key-activities of the project viz. recruitments, field trainings, data
collection, team movement, data compilation etc.

a. Inputs Stage
The recruitment and engagement of teams were the key focus during preparatory stage to ensure that field
teams are:
> The enumerators and supervisors were hired taking into consideration their educational background,
experience and other relevant qualifications.
> Adequately skilled with survey procedures during trainings.
> Before the launch of actual field work just after the training, all the participants undergone for an
evaluation test with the help of a set of questionnaires.
> Final selection of the surveyors who scored satisfactory marks

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS Paces |

J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Standardization of trainings: Since the trainings were proceeded in phases hence standardization of the training
content was important. Considering this, all the trainings were organized by proposed survey team who were
the part of centralized training of trainers (TOT) held in New Delhi. This ensured the standardization and
consistency during the field trainings. Routing through them, communication of same set of protocols/guidelines
was ensured in all the field trainings.

b. Data Collection Stage

The data collection across the country was conducted by 182 field teams. Each team consisted of one field
supervisor and four enumerators. The number of interviewing teams in each state varied according to the sample
size. The field supervisor was responsible for overall management of the field teams. In addition, the field
supervisor conducted spot-checks to verify the accuracy of key information.

During the data collection period IVA submitted weekly progress reports to MDWS on aspects of the total
coverage, back check results, challenges encountered, and the ways challenges were addressed and
troubleshooting practices.

The definition of Household which was critical in this survey, was defined as per National Sample Survey
classification and was included in the training manual for clear understanding of the surveyors. A Unique Numeric
identification code for each questionnaire and surveyor/supervisors was inbuilt in CAPI.

The quality at data collection stage was primarily determined by following key aspects in each of the phases of
data collection.
Listing Phase
> Accuracy of selected PSU
> Complete listing of all the settlement/selected segment
> Correctness of information captured pertaining to listed HHs
Main Survey Phase
> Coverage of selected HHs
> Correctness of information captured
> Adherence to ethical protocol and guidelines
> Regularity of data upload
Village Level Survey Phase
> Survey completeness in identified School /Anganwadi.
> Correctness of information captured pertaining to selected school, Anganwadi worker/ASHA,
Sarpanch/GP Secretary or other prominent people in the village.
> Ensuring geo-tagged photographs for each survey category of the sampled villages.

C. Data Validation Stage:

Apart from quality controls at data collection level, IVA also ensured that the data is compiled and integrated
error free. A robust data monitoring and validation system was placed to ensure data quality. Sample back-checks
visits were also made by IVA as well as MDWS teams to verify field data quality.

On a regular basis, the field teams synced all the completed interviews to the cloud- based server. Supervisors
maintained record of all the completed interviews in their log sheet used for reporting and checks. It was state
coordinators’ responsibility to monitor the coverage, quality and logistical aspects of the data collection activity
by doing frequent field visits and checking the data on the server regularly. In addition to this, surprise field visits
were also made by zonal coordinator/ national team on random basis.

Translation of tools
Translation of the survey tool in regional language is one of the imperative tasks which includes the importance
of maintaining the equivalence of concepts and ensure a procedure that identifies possible pitfalls and avoids
distortion of the meaning of each question. Following steps was adopted to ensure the quality measures:
v Translation of all kind of survey tool (Household & Village survey & Training Manual) was done to
produce a locally understandable questionnaire
Vv The original intent of the questions was translated with the best possible equivalent terms in the local
language
VY Question-by-question specifications was aimed to convey the original meaning of the questions and pre-
coded response options
v The questionnaire was translated by health and survey experts who have a basic understanding of the
key concepts of the subject-matter content.
v Later, a set of selected key terms and those that proved to be problematic during the first direct
translation was further checked by regional offices and suggested changes was incorporated
Vv Finally, the translated version was shared with MDWS for their review.
Training of State Coordinators & Surveyors

Training of survey team is the key to quality. Training is an ongoing process that is conducted before and during
the data-collection process, and end with a detailed feedback session after the fieldwork period is completed.
Training for NARSS was provided at all levels of the survey team involved in the survey, from interviewers to
trainers and supervisors, as well as to the central team overseeing the process nationally. This was done to ensure
that all involved persons are clear with regard to their role in ensuring good quality of data.

To fulfil the part of the training purpose, IVA & MDWS has organized National workshop for State Coordinators
from all participating countries and produced various training materials, including a training video and an

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS P)Pacess |


--- Page 40 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

educational compact disk covering all sanitation aspects issues. The purpose of overall training was aimed to
meet the following parameters:

Vv Ensure a uniform application of the survey materials and CAPI

v Explain the rationale of the study and study protocol

Y Motivate interviewers

Vv Provide practical suggestions

v Improve the overall quality of the data
To fulfil the part of the training purpose, IVA & MDWS has organized National workshop for State Coordinators
from all participating states and produced various training materials, including a training module covering all
sanitation aspects issues pertaining to NARSS. The workshop was held in Delhi before the state training started
in each location.
Selection of survey teams

Vv The preference of using experienced interviewers as well as people who are familiar with the topic of
the survey was important for NARSS, hence preliminary selection of interviewers was done on the basis
of required qualification and be fluent in the main or regional language of the state

vIn each training location, state offices have carried out formal assessment of the surveyors before they
appeared for the training. The characteristics of the interviewers (age, sex, education, professional
training, employment status, past survey experience, and so on) was assessed and recorded on a
separate database.

Vv The training methods included as much role playing in interviews as possible (with a minimum of one
per interviewer). This method provided the assimilation of interviewing techniques more effectively

Vv For role playing to be effective, different kind of scenarios (wrt access, functionality of toilet etc) was
prepared in advance of the training so that the different branching structures of the interview, the nature
of explanations that are permitted, and anticipated problems during an interview with difficult
respondents can be illustrated

Vv As recommended by MDWS, a booster session was also organised in each state during the data-
collection period. The booster session served to review various aspects of data collection, focusing on
those undertakings that were proving complex and difficult or those guidelines that are not being
adhered to sufficiently by interviewers.

Vv This session was also helped to provide feedback on how much has been achieved and the positive
aspects, including feedback from the supervisors and central survey team to the interviewers, as well as
from interviewers to the supervisors and survey team.

v All the trainees were evaluated in order to determine whether they are capable of interviewing
effectively and what, if any, particular support or orientation was required. The assessment was
conducted on last day of training by using an evaluation paper.

v The assessment of trainees (supervisor & interviewers) was conducted by central survey team and
MDWS.

2. Data Collection Stage

To plan and manage the survey implementation is a complex task, logistically and otherwise. It requires much
preparation, scheduling and moving around of forces in the field to obtain the desired sample. Strategically,
survey implementation is a key element that determines whether survey data is of a good quality or not. Hence

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS PPaceao | 40


--- Page 41 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

to ensure the quality checks, IVA had adopted different type of quality measures during data collection. Following
measures were carried out in the due course of NARSS.

Accompaniment

NARSS was implemented with a composition of 4 interviewers and 1 supervisor. Each interviewer spent 2-3 days
to cover all the survey component and achieved the desired sample in each PSU.

e Supervisor was mainly responsible to set out the daily work at the beginning of the workday with the
interviewers and reviewed the results at the end of the day. In this review, interviewers were briefed
their supervisors about their interviews and results.

e Supervisors examined the completed interviews in the CAPI console and log sheet to make sure that the
interviewer's selection of the household has been done correctly and that the questionnaire is both
complete and accurately coded

e Correctness in preparing lay out map and segmentation was also checked by Supervisor during
accompaniment.

A daily logbook was also maintained to monitor the progress of the survey work in every state survey center.
Following elements were recorded as a part of log sheet:
v The number of respondents approached
v_ Interviews completed and incomplete interviews
v_ The response, refusal and non-contact rates
While accompanying the interviewer, supervisor observed the way of administering the questionnaire and any
kind of biases was led by the interviewer (i. e naming of SBM, interpretation of responses shared by the
respondent etc). Supervisors were also made effort to reconvince the non-response cases such as refusal
conversions for both household & village survey.
Back Check
This check was done by in person or by phone and structured to ensure that the initial interview has been
conducted properly. The recheck interview in the same selected household was done through a back check CAPI
link and covered the critical questions along with some basic demographic information. In NARSS, apart from
team supervisor (Back-checked- % households of total back-checked), central IVA team (% households back-
checked of total back-checked) and State coordinators (% households back-checked of total back-checked) had
carried out several field visits in different states to oversee the progress of work and quality checks. EWG &
MDWS also did the random visits in couple of states along with IVA team.
During back-check survey of the PSUs and household, the following points were observed by the team:

1. Clusters and hamlets of the PSUs.
Segmentation and boundaries.
House-listing and structure number.
Sampled households and log sheets maintained by the field team.
Whether the field team visited the selected household for the main survey.
Whether photographs of the toilets taken during household survey.
Ownership of the toilet
Accessibility to the toilet.
Disposal methods of excreta
Role of supervisor- Supervisors did back-check of the sampled households based on the log sheet entry which

Pw OnNnaVPWDN

had the records of all the selected household wherein the main survey was already done by the interviewer. All

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS Paces |


--- Page 42 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

back-check interview conducted by the supervisor was freshly done through CAPI console and uploaded in the
server.

Role of central IVA team- The central IVA team based on the raw data available through dashboard, undertook
the following action:

1. Created run tine report which presented erroneous trend of data.

2. Identified the PSUs or Households with unusual data trends.

3. Sharing of anomaly report with respective state IVA offices for physical verification.

4. Based on the run-time report of key sanitation indicators, the central IVA teams made field visit plan for
back-checks of PSUs and households.

5. Anomaly report, wherein the codes recorded during data collection were not in-sync with its
corresponding questions, was shared with state coordinators. Based on the anomaly report, the state
coordinators revisited the households which seemed to be inconsistent in responses. The data was
collected through back-check CAPI link and got it uploaded to the server.

6. Variance Report was generated basis the main raw data and back-check data available on server. If any
variance was observed between two data sets, over-writing of data took place. Here variance was
defined as below:

e During main survey- No access to the toilet facilities reported, however, accessibility to the toilet
was recorded during back-check visit in the same HH or village facility (Vis-a-vis).

e Usage of the toilet was not reported by few or all members of HH. In back-check visit, toilet was
used (Vis-a-vis).

e Toilets were reported to be non-functional/ unsafe technology/ un-hygienic during main survey
but during back-check, the toilets were found to be functional/ safe/ hygienic (Vis-a-vis).

Role of MDWS- As a part of data quality assurance measures, the MDWS constituted internal quality control
teams to oversee the compliance of quality assurance protocols. The MDWS quality assurance team also
reviewed raw data and reports and also the issues triggered through dashboard. The team planned their field
visit for back-checks. For back-check visit, the MDWS teams were facilitated through real time information of
field movement of teams. The feedback/ issues of field data collection were communicated to the IVA and that
IVA reviewed and took corrective action immediately. The preventive action plan for systematic errors/ mistakes
were prepared and communicated to the field teams for maintaining a standardization of data collection process.

Prominent issues found in back-check and measures taken for quality control
As a part of quality assurance of NARSS survey, certain points were taken into consideration while conducting

the back-check survey of the households which were already covered in the main survey team visit. Any variation
recorded during the back-check, eventually led the action taken by the back-check teams. The points are
mentioned as given below:
1. The visited PSUs were verified through the village source whether the sampled PSUs were covered or
not.
2. Sampled households were verified through the listing document and proper numbering of the structure
were observed.
3. Details of Member of the households were checked.

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS PPaceaz |

4. Accessibility of toilets were verified. (If variance was found in the back-check, the same was over-wrote

in main data)

5. Functionality, hygienic conditions, usage of toilets, water availability, littering and water logging were
also observed and verified through back-check.

6. Technology used in the toilets were observed and verified.

Further to describe the above table, once the data was at dashboard, programs checked for inconsistencies,

missing values, problems with identification numbers or test/re-test cases. These programs produced a report
to be sent back to the states as part of weekly status. Basic descriptive statistics were used to determine the
response distributions and identify any skewed distributions, odd results and outliers.

IVA central team sent such critical cases to states. The states reverted with corrections and/or explanations in
accordance with the feedback, any corrections received from the IVA states are applied to the data.

5.3. Important quality measures undertaken

A. Geotagged photographs and their linkage to the sanitation assets checked

The following features are in place with Kantar to check the correctness of geotagged photographs and their

linkages to the sanitation assets of household and village observed during survey:

|. Each photograph captured while conducting household or village interviews for every asset

(Accessibility, Functionality, Hygienic condition, usage of toilet and safe disposal practices), were
tagged with CAPI generated unique identification numbers with specific question numbers. For
instance, during household interview, all the photographs captured have had the same unique ID as
tagged with household interview.

ll. This system indicated that the photographs belonged to which household or village interview. In this
way, the quality team identified the photos corresponding to its interview.

Ill. Every household and village interviews were tagged with unique ID, which was in-built in CAPI
programming. Each asset (Accessibility, Functionality, Hygienic condition, usage of toilet and safe
disposal practices) observed during the survey of either household or village, have got specific
question numbers which helps identifying the types of assets being observed.

IV. However, for all assets, the unique ID (which remains the identification of the HH or village
interview) remained same which was tagged with photographs.

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS PPaceaa | 44


--- Page 45 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

V. Besides this, geo-coordinates were also tagged with each photograph captured during the survey
which indicated the location of interview in the village.

B. Whether unique codes were used for CAPI, surveyor, the questionnaire and the interview

Unique identification code was in-built programming of CAPI for household & village questionnaires. Besides,
interview ID (for both household and village components), an automated CAPI ID was also generated through
CAPI. The surveyors ID was allotted by Kantar State office. This helped identifying specific interview which took
place in its specific villages and states.

c. Whether the geolocations of the surveyors were used to track their work

Each CAPI machines used in the NARSS survey, were enabled with GPS location. The field team who possessed
the CAPI could have been easily tracked as to where the interviews were conducted by them. Before initiating
the interview, the interviewer had to feed the interviewer's ID in the CAPI which specifically indicated that the
particular CAPI was used by some already identified interviewer. This helped the quality team to track the work
of a particular interviewer, once the data was synchronized with the cloud server.

Dz. Actions of ACQA team of IVA

ACQA team is quality assurance team who did visit the field to conduct sample quality back-checks and to
accompany the field teams to observe the interview and identify if the teams were following survey protocols
and if the data collection teams faced any challenges in technical or operational aspect of the survey.

The ACQA team adopted the following measures of data quality assurance:

a. Digital checks- Under the digital checks, the data quality was monitored through the data
itself. The points which were taken into consideration while doing digital checks are as
follows:

I. Length of Interview (LOI): For this, the data was reviewed to check if the interview
conducted in the field took enough time (length of interview) to engage the respondent
to complete the interview. If the LOI was less than 10 minutes, actions were warranted.

ll. Time gap between two interviews: Once the interview was completed, the interviewer
proceeded to initiate another household or village interview. Therefore, time gap
between the interview was also monitored. If the time gap between two interviews was
found unreasonable, the quality check team took required steps as to where the
problems existed, and which team did the mistake by identifying through CAPI code &
interviewer’s ID.

lll. Odd hours: The field teams can only conduct interview between 6 am to 11 pm. The
quality check teams identified from the dataset if any of the interview was conducted
other than the prescribed hours. If any such cases were reported through the dataset,
the interviews were rejected.

IV. | Unusual productivity checks: Every team member was assigned with the reasonable
tasks which were to be completed on daily basis. If any unusual things in terms of loads
of work, came across while reviewing the dataset, were identified and subjected to
scrutiny by the state office of Kantar.

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS PPaceas |


--- Page 46 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

V. Photographs based authenticity checks: As discussed earlier, each photograph captured
while conducting household or village interviews, were tagged with system generated
unique identification numbers. For instance, during household interview, all the
photographs captured have had same unique ID as tagged with household interview.
This was how the quality team identified the photos corresponding to its interview.

VI. GPS based location checks: GPS based location checks were done to ensure that the
interviews conducted were happened to be in sampled PSUs only. This was done
through plotting of geo-coordinates to arrive at the exact location where the teams were
supposed to visit.

Overview of quality check process: Based on the digital check, either the interview got

rejected or accepted for further telephonic back-checks or personal back-checks.

Physical checks- The physical checks comprised of the following tasks which were to be

undertaken while doing quality checks:

|. Telephonic back-checks: Quality assurance teams did random telephonic back-checks
and recorded the responses of the respondents. Basis the data captured, variance report
was generated and shared with client. MDWS teams also did telephonic back-checks at
random basis.

I. In person back-checks: Core team members of NARSS conducted back-check visit to the
field to verify that the data collection teams visited the field and that the quality data
was collected by them. Back-check visits were undertaken across all states where NARSS
survey was conducted.

E. Preventive action plan for systematic errors / mistakes and communicating errors/ mistakes frequently

to the field teams

The agency took following action to prevent the systematic errors/ mistakes committed by the field data

collection teams:

Vi.

Once the CAPI was synchronized at the end of the day after data collection, the data was saved
at the cloud server securely and eventually got displayed on dashboard.

The data was analysed for the key indicators and if the core team members identified any
mistakes or error, the state teams were intimated through conference call to address the issue
and to closely monitor the team which were found to be having the tendency of committing
mistakes.

Based on the observation, key performance question data feedbacks were shared regularly with
the field teams.

If any anomaly in data was identified, a con-call was fix up taking the field teams into loop and
discussed the issues. Sometimes, the MDWS teams were also the part of con-call while discussing
with the field teams.

State field teams also relied on KOOL (Kantar Operations Online) software (owned by Kantar)
with inbuilt feature of throwing inconsistency reports of the key sanitation indicators.

KOOL software was integrated with the survey dashboard and based on the inconsistency checks
through this software, the concerned team came into action and did revisit to the PSUs as and
when required.

CHAPTER-5S: QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS PPaceas | 46


--- Page 47 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Vil. The core team members of the NARSS survey received dashboard (Other than survey
dashboard) from analysis team on daily basis to review the key indicators of NARSS and recorded
the inconsistency and eventually took the state field team into loop to apprise then the trend of
the data and asked them to take corrective actions.

F. Action plan in consultation with MDWS team for following points

a. Quality of the data collected

The following actions were taken based on the discussions happened with MDWS:

Vi.

Weekly progress report, weekly quality check reports and variance reports were shared with
MDWS team for their review.

In quality check reports, the MDWS team was conveyed with incident log which comprises of a
particular area/PSU’s complexity faced by our local teams while the teams stayed at the PSUs.
In case of non-cooperation from the village heads, the same were communicated to the state
coordinators and finally to the MDWS team.

Sometimes, the PSUs were also replaced due to the issues discussed above.

The replacement was done from the buffer PSU list.

In response to the incident log, the MDWS team, at regular interval, provided feedback to the
agency which were further taken up to the field team to take the stock of that and to
strengthen the field survey data collection planning.

b. Efficiency of the training, trainers and field management

The field training reports were submitted to the MDWS

The training report consisted of the number of field team participated and selected for final
survey, duration of training, methods of training, details of core team members and participant
from the MDWS and EWG members, total modules covered, and details of field practice which
was taken place in the non-sampled villages.

The trainers who conducted training at the state level, were participant of the TOT conducted
by the MDWS and that they had best understanding of the sanitation related surveys and
programmes.

The state field office of the agency had prior experience of managing manpower of large-scale
surveys of the similar kinds.

c. Efficiency and skills of the manpower after the trainings
At the end of the state level training, the team’s performance was evaluated through a set of
questionnaires based on core area of the study.
The final selection of the teams was made by evaluating the minimum understanding of the
project.

d. Overall responsiveness of the project teams
As and when the field teams were intimated for the mistakes, the teams responded effectively
and tried their best to go by the survey protocols and to collect the high-quality data.

e. Transparency and flexibility
i. The data collection teams got clarity of the NARSS project and as to how to capture high quality
data from the field.
ii. For day to day activity, the teams got in touch with supervisors and state coordinators and in
case of need, they sought help from them in terms of operational issues which they came across
while being at the field.

f. Timelines of activity completion
i. The field teams strictly adhered with the timeline which was set-up for the project to get
completed.
ii. Field progress report was shared with MDWS which comprised of the coverage report and
number of teams working in the field at real time.

Data Overwriting Protocol:
Data overwriting is required once any household are back checked either by Supervisor or by any senior person
from research / ministry. To do the back check we have developed separate back check link which is functional
and through this link we are able to re-collect entire information for a HH and for village tool as well.
All the data which are collected by a FLP (investigator) is stored on our secured server, similarly back check data
(collected by supervisor / IVA core team member / MDWS personal) will also be stored same server.
Steps which was adopted has furnished below:
1. Normal Back check

> Supervisor / IVA core team member / MDWS personal did back check with a separate back check link

and collected the data

> The collected stored on server.

> At the back-end we generated a variance report on regular basis.

> If any variance was observed between two data sets, the interviewer data was replaced by the back-

check data.

2. Back check which is being carried out by looking at the data for any PSU

> Data which was available on dashboard was analysed by IVA core team member
PSU which behaved like outlier (variation more than 30 percent) was sent back for further verification.
Supervisor / State coordinator /Zonal coordinator / revisited the PSU
During back-check same back check link was used
After they re-collected the data similar process as stated above in point no 1 was adopted for data
overwriting.
Data Cleaning and Transfer Protocol: Before uploading data to National Informatics Centre (NIC) server,
variables were recoded, cleaned as per the logical checks and the identifiers used. Pictorial flow of the data
management is shown in the figure given below:

CHAPTER-6: DLI COMPUTATION AND VALUES- INDIA & STATES

6.1. DLI CALCULATION NOTE FOR NARSS ROUND-2

1. Objective

he World Bank through the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation’ supports following two categories
T of activities:

a) Performance incentives for sanitation improvement in rural areas; (USS 1475 Million)

b) Technical Assistance for strengthening institutional capacities on program management, advocacy,
and communications, and implementing a credible and robust monitoring & evaluation system to
measure results of SBM-G. (USS 25 Million)

The Bank Program (PforR component of the Operation) supports the entire national SBM-G program by
channelling US$1.475 billion through the incentive grant window of SBM-G in support of the national program’s
objective of recognizing and rewarding the performance of states on achieving key sanitation outcomes. Program
funds will be disbursed to MDWS on achievement of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) and MDWS will
release grant funds to states, based on their performance.

2. About Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLI)
SBM-G performance of the states against the disbursement linked indicators (DLI) is to be measured through
conducting national annual rural sanitation survey (NARSS). Distribution of financial incentives to states would
be proportional to the actual performance of the states. The four DLIs identified for this purpose are:

>  DLI #1: Reduction in the prevalence of Open Defecation

> DLI#2: Sustaining ODF Status in villages

>  DLI #3: Increase of rural population with Solid Liquid Waste Management

> DLI #4: Operationalization of Performance Incentive Grants by MDWS
As per the requirements of SBMSO, the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) has been conducted by
an Independent Verification Agency (IVA) for ensuring credibility and objectivity of survey results.

3. Process of DLI Computation

For each of the DLIs, there are certain performance parameters specified in the Operations Manual of SBMSO,
which have been captured in the NARSS survey protocol, for measurement by the IVA. Population in absolute
number for the Universe is derived from the DLI proportion extrapolated to the MoSPI 2018 total projected rural
population of states and union territories. (Source MDWS). For DLI-2, since MoSPI does not project population
projections for ODF villages, their proportionate share is considered as explained under DLI-2

Appropriate weights have been applied for deriving the values at Universe level, based on sample observations.
Details are in Annex-1.

DISBURSEMENT LINKED INDICATOR #1
Indicator - Reduction in the prevalence of Open Defecation

Rationale — This DLI focuses on the reduction in the prevalence of OD based on the rural population having
access to sanitation facilities and using them always, as per the definitions in the Operations Manual.

CHAPTER-6: DLI COMPUTATION AND VALUES- INDIA & STATES PPaceso |


--- Page 51 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Based on these definitions, a group of parameters have been agreed in the NARSS protocol for determining DLI
1, which are as below:
Y Access to a toilet
Functionality of the toilet
Toilets with safe disposal mechanism of human excreta
Toilet is hygienic
Usage of a Toilet always and
Safe disposal of Child faeces

SSN KN

Process of Calculating DLI# 1- Following processes has been followed to calculate DLI 1:

Step 1 - Count of total Population (Child + Adult) — derived after removing those HHs where
the enumerator/HH could not establish the technology type. (Denominator)

Step 2 — Numerator established using count of adult population, always using functional,
hygienic and safe toilet.

Step 3 — In some HHs (6.5%), which reported having a septic tank toilet without soak pit, the
safe disposal mechanism could not be established. In such cases, the analysis adopted a
similar approach for estimating the safe sanitation as followed by UNICEF/WHO Joint
Monitoring Program, when sufficient information is not available (i.e., considering 50% of
such cases as having safe disposal mechanisms)

Step 4 - Further count of child population in the above households where disposal of faeces

is through safe methods (Buried in the ground & Put into the toilet) have been included in the
numerator.
Step 5 — Added Adult and child population that came from step 3 and Step 4 also in the
numerator
> Step 6 —-Converted the number into percentage
DLI#1=Count of total population always using toilet (Step 5) + Count of total population (step 1)

Using the above, NARSS-2 assessed that 82.7 % of rural population of India i.e. 72,81,44,072 are using
toilets that are safe, functional, hygiene.

DISBURSEMENT LINKED INDICATOR #2:
Indicator- Sustaining ODF Status in villages
Rationale- DLI 2 measures rural Population of ODF villages showing sustained ODF status.
This DLI measures performance of a sub-set of villages, which are already verified by the SBM-G teams as ODF,
that are called ODF verified villages, as on June 6, 2018 — the cut-off date suggested by the EWG.
The DLI has been calculated based on the parameters suggested in the NARSS protocol for defining an ODF
Village. This includes the following:
v¥_ All Households have Access to a toilet
All members of a Household always use the toilet
Child faeces is safely disposed
Schools have access to toilet and is in use
AWC have access to toilet and is in use

S\N NK

All toilets are functional
Vv Alltoilets have safe disposal mechanism

CHAPTER-6: DLI COMPUTATION AND VALUES- INDIA & STATES Paces |


--- Page 52 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Vv Alltoilets are Hygienic and
Vv There is absence of visible faeces in village surroundings and places which were used historically for
open defecation

Considerations- All parameters are binary in nature hence any village which has failed on any of the above
criteria has been considered as not confirming to the ODF status.
Also, as per the EWG meeting held in December 2017, a maximum of 5% margin of error shall be granted at the
aggregate level ina village to neutralize response error and accordingly the status of usage would be determined
to determine the ODF status of the village.
Process of Calculating DLI# 2- Following process has been followed to calculate DLI# 2:
Population projection of DLI#2 as per MoSPI 2018
To arrive at the extrapolated population for DLI#2, i.e., population living in ODF villages, the following steps
have been undertaken:
To arrive at the extrapolated population for DLI#2, i.e., population living in ODF villages, the following steps
have been undertaken:

RO

%* A- Total population surveyed (ODF+Non-ODF)

B- ODF population (Besides the population living in the villages not qualifying ODF condition)
C- Total ODF population verified through NARSS

D- Calculation of DLI#2 score (% verified ODF population among ODF population) (C/B*100)
E- % ODF population among total surveyed population (B/A*100)

F- Rural population (MoSPI)

G- Calculation of ODF universe by projecting to the MoSPI population (F*E/100)

J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Using the above computation, DLI 2 value is based on an assessment that 90.4 % of the population i.e.

36,21,83,642 is living in ODF verified villages that meet criteria for sustained ODF.

DISBURSEMENT LINKED INDICATOR #3

Indicator- Increase of rural population with Solid Liquid Waste Management

Rationale- DLI 3 focuses on population with solid and liquid waste management
As per Operations Manual, DLI 3 is to be determined using a group of parameters included in the household
schedule and village schedule and are as below.
- Absence of garbage or litter piled up or dumped within the premise of the house
- Absence of stagnant waste water within the premise of the house
- Village level collection and treatment of solid and liquid waste
- Public places in a village show minimal level of littering
- Public places in a village show minimal level of water logging
- Disposal mechanism for solid waste at HH level
- Disposal mechanism for liquid waste at HH level
Considerations
a) Villages which have been observed to have minimal littering and minimal stagnant water were considered
as having improved SLWM and other PSUs will fail and that the population in such villages will not qualify.
b) Villages which have performed safe disposal of solid waste (Community level composting arrangement
(NADEP/ Vermi-compost etc.), community level waste collection arrangement & segregated waste collected
and safely managed).
c) Village which have performed safe disposal of waste water (Flows in some kind of safe system & some kind
of treatment- into drain, kitchen garden and soak pit)
d) Any HHs which were observed to have any garbage or litter piled up or dumped and having stagnant waste
water within the premises of the households will fail, and population in that household will not qualify.
e) Inaddition to cleanliness of the premises, the households which performed safe disposal of solid and liquid
waste, the population from such households were considered as having improved SLWM.

J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

Process of Calculating DLI# 3
Following process has been followed to calculate DLI# 3:

Step 1 — Identified villages where Public Spaces questionnaire is not done. (0 village)
Step 2 — Counted total number of adult and child population in remaining villages and derived the Denominator.
Step 3 — Identified the villages from Public Spaces Survey data, not qualifying the criteria of Solid & Liquid waste. i.e.
Coded “No” in Q8 & Q9 and solid and liquid waste disposal systems i.e. Coded 1, 2 or 3 in Q6 and 1 or 2 in Q7
respectively.
Step 4 — Removed HHs from Household data for villages identified in step 3.
Step 5 — Identified and removed the households where “Yes” is coded in both Q10 and Q12 of HH data - that means
garbage or litter piled up or dumped, stagnant waste water found within the premise of the house.
Step 6 — Identified and removed the households where safe disposal mechanism was present for both solid and liquid
waste, i.e., coded “indiscriminate” in Q11 and Q13 of HH data
Step 7 - Count of total number of adult and child population of remaining HH from step 7 (Numerator).
Step 8 — % of adult and child population (Step 7 and step 2).

DLI#3-Count of total number of adult and child population (step 7) + count of total number of adult and child population (step2)

Using the above computation, the DLI 3 was derived based on an assessment of 63.3% of rural population,
ie. 55,77,30,094 which are practicing solid & liquid waste management.

2622 villages (90.7%) of all 2891 ODF-verified villages surveyed were confirmed to be ODF. The remaining 269
villages (9.3%) were not confirmed ODF due to any of the following reasons:

1. Lower than 100% access to toilets in the village

2. Presence of unhygienic/dysfunctional/unsafe toilet in any household in the village

3. Non-usage of a toilet by the household members

4. Non-access of a toilet in schools or anganwadis

5. Presence of visible fecal matter in the village.
It may be noted that the average access to toilets in these 269 villages was about 93%.

2. 34.1% households were APL

3. 59.4% households were BPL

4 15.14% of households having the children less than 3 years

8.1. INTRODUCTION

his chapter presents information on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the household
T members in the surveyed households (N=92411) from 6136 PSUs, such as age, gender, number of children
aged below 3 years, social categories, economic status of households and average household size. This
information is useful for understanding the relationship between background characteristics that affect access
and use of toilets, hygiene and sanitation behaviour, and household’s solid and liquid waste management
mechanism.

8.2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLDS

8.2.1. Social category of head of the households

Social category wise analysis indicated that at an overall level, close to half of the households (43.1%) belonged
to the Other Backward Caste (OBC). Three out of ten households were of general category (29.6%) while 23.7
percent of the households belonged to Scheduled Caste. Category wise analysis indicated that in ODF areas,
majority of households were of other backward category (38.9%) followed by General category (32.4%) and ST
(13.6%) while in non-ODF areas, OBC households were in majority (46.9%) followed by general category
households (27.0%) and ST households (12.8%). The trend of the percentage of the households falling under
various social categories is same irrespective of the village category. Please refer annexure table-HH: 1 for

8.2.2. Economic category of head of the households
To gauge the socio-economic classification of the surveyed households, the head of the households were asked

about the economic category to which their household belonged to. Overall, close to six out of ten households
(59.4%) reported that their household was a below poverty line (BPL) household whereas one-third households
(34.1%) indicated to be an above poverty line (APL) household. 6.6 percent of the total sampled households did
not know their economic classification. Category wise analysis indicated that a similar trend was prevalent across
ODF and non-ODF areas, as could be seen in the table below. Please refer HH:2 & table:6 for additional

The table shows that of the total sampled households surveyed in the NARSS, in overall, the maximum number
of the households belonged to the OBC which is accounted to 43.1 percent followed by general and scheduled
tribe which constituted 29.6 percent and 13.2 percent respectively. The trend in similar across both village
category, however, the percent distribution varies across the category.

As far as the economic categories of the households are concerned, the majority belonged to the BPL category
which is 59.4 percent followed by the APL which account to be 34.1 percent. As seen in social category, in
economic category also, the trend of distribution of the households are similar across both the available village
categories. Refer table:6

8.3. Demographic characteristics of the survey population

8.3.1. Gender of the survey population

The data on the gender of the population, presented in the following table, indicated that higher number of the
male members were reported in the surveyed households than the female members which is 52.3 percent &
47.7 percent respectively. The percentage distribution of both genders is similar across ODF and Non-ODF villages
at national level. (Refer table:7)

under age 15 represents 24.6 percent of the surveyed population, while individual age 65 and older represents
5.9 percent of the surveyed population. Percent distribution of the population in the household belonging to the
ODF villages shows a slight change in trend wherein majority of the population (19.0%) belongs to the age group
of 15-24 years followed by the age group <15 years which represents 22.1 percent. In Non-ODF households also,
<15 age-group forms majority of the population with percentage of 26.7 percent. (Refer table:7)

9.1. INTRODUCTION

his chapter presents information on key saniation indicators of the households. These indicators included
T access, functionality, hygienic condition, availability of water for toilet usage, technological options used in
the toilet and solid & liquid waste management in rural households. In addition, this chapter also describes the
characteristics of the population covered under surveyed households with respect to the usage of the toilet and
the practice of safe disposal of excreta of childern <3 years.

*For calculations of functionality, hygienic status, safe disposal of excreta, usage of toilet & availability of water,
base (n=84590) will be used.

9.2. | ACCESS TO TOILETS

In the survey, the information on accessibility of toilet facility for the household was collected through a
combination of four responses which included i) Own toilet : Households having access to toilet which is
exclusively used by members of the household ii) Shared toilet: Household having access to toilet used by
multiple families iii) Community toilets: Households having access to a Public toilet facility (toilet is open to the
general public) and iv) No toilet access : Households do not have access to any toilet (family members usually
defecate in the bush, fields, or other locations).

Among all the surveyed households (n=92411), the households which had access to toilets represents 93.3 at
national level. Almost all the household in ODF villages (98.0%) have access to toilet while households of non-
ODF villages reported 89.1 percent toilet access.

ODF & Non-ODF households rely on different set-up of toilet facilities depending on ownership status. Main type
of toilet to which the ODF households getting access to, is own toilet (89.9%), shared toilet (6.9%) and community
toilet (1.1%). In Non-ODF households also, the trend of using the types of toilet is same, however, the percent of
households in own toilet is accounted to 73.9 percent, shared toilet (12.9%) and community toilet (2.3%). Overall,
6.7 percent of households do not have access to toilet facilities, meaning they practice open defecation.

State-wise analysis of data shows that the states of North-east (Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland & Sikkim) & Dadra
and Nagar Haveli have all the households (100%) with access to toilet. At national level, the state which have
reported toilet access in more than 99 percent households but below 100 percent, are Kerala (99.9%), Tamilnadu
(99.7%), Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh & Meghalaya (99.6% each), Uttarakhand (99.5%) and ANI (99.2%). The
percent distribution of toilet access in four states have been reported below 90 percent. The states are J&K
(85.3%), Jharkhand (84.7%), Bihar (73.6%) and Odisha (72.2%). The households of ODF villages of Jharkhand
reported below 90 percent of toilet access which accounts to be 89.9 percent followed by Bihar (85.9%).
Surprisingly, across all states Bihar is the only state wherein ODF (85.9%) and Non-ODF (72.9%) households both
have reported low toilet access.

9.3. | PATTERNS OF HOUSEHOLD ACCESS BY SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

The distribution of households by social categories shows that more than 9 households out of 10 have access to
toilet facilities. The households which belong to the general category have got highest access which constitutes
96.4 percent while 95 percent are scheduled caste, 92.1 percent are scheduled tribe, and 91.2 percent are other
backward caste.

The percentage of ODF households with access to the toilet facilities is on higher side (98.0%) as compared to
the Non-ODF households (89.1%).

The table depicts the accessibility status of the households by socio-economic categories. Out of the tota

households which have got access to the toilet facilities, majority of the households belonged to the general
category which is accounted to 96.4 percent followed by the households belonged to the scheduled caste which

CHAPTER-9: AVAILABILITY AND STATUS OF TOILETS IN HOUSEHOLDS Pacer |


--- Page 72 ---
J interim Report | Report National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS), Round-2, 2018-2019

is 95.0 percent of the total accessible households. The number of households which are reported the lowest in
this category belonged to the other backward caste (91.2%). In ODF category, the percent distribution of the
households belonging to the different social category with toilet access is almost universal and that almost all
the households have access to the toilet except the household which belongs to other backward caste where the
accessibility percentage is lowest among other caste category.

Accessibility to the toilet facility also varies as per the economic categories of the households. The table depicts
that the households belonging to the APL category have got higher access as compared to the BPL category which
constitutes 95.1 percent in overall. The BPL households have got 92.1 percent toilet access. Please refer table:10
for detailed information.

9.4. _ FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HOUSEHOLD TOILETS

The functionality status of the toilet was determined by observing four components in the toilet. These
components were whether the i) pan/seat was completely broken ii) pan was choked iii) pits/tanks were
completely covered iv) pipes were broken or open. Based on the above parameters, overall functionality of the
households were reported to be 98.6 percent. Functionality status of households which belongs to the ODF
village represents 99.7 percent where almost all the households have got functional toilet. In households toilet
of the non-ODF villages, functionality status represents 97.5 percent.

State-wise analysis of data shows that the households of the majority of the states reported to have more than
98 percent functional toilet. Only few states like Madhya Pradesh (97.8%), Uttar Pradesh (97.7%), Assam (97.6%),
Punjab & Goa (97.3% each), Tamilnadu (96.9%), Jharkhand (96.4%) and Odisha (96%) have functionality status
below 98 percent.

Almost all the households across the states under ODF category have functional toilet except Jharkhand which
reported to have only 93.9 percent functional toilet. Households of non-ODF villages of Punjab represents 94.1
percent with functional toilet which is lowest in this village category. HH:5 presents the detail.

9.5. AVAILABILITY OF WATER FOR TOILET USAGE

Availability of water for toilets usage was observed for the household reported access to a toilet. The response
of the households was recorded by asking whether the toilet had any evidence of water supply, or household
had piped water supply in the toilet, or small water turf/tank next to the toilet, or bucket of water kept next to
the toilet, or presence of well or hand-pump in the house premises, or presence of any other water sources. The
dat shows that in India, almost all rural households across the different village category (99.7% each in ODF and
non-ODF village) had availability of water. Majority of the households had water available within the house
premises which represents 69.1 percent. The main source of water found within the premises of the house in
majority of the households across both the village category. However, the household belonging to the ODF village
represents 72.2 percent have water available within the premises of the house while Non-ODF household
represents 66 percent with water available with the premises. (HH:6 presents the detail).

TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIONS

The survey tried to verify whether safe technology is adopted in the household’s toilets for disposal. The
household toilets were observed to see whether the toilet is connected to a tank/pit or to a sewer system. The
household toilets which were found to be connected to a tank/ pit or to a sewer system at national level
represents 99.6 percent. In ODF household toilet, the percentage is same as in national level. However, the Non-
ODF household toilets represents 99.2 percent, connected to a tank/ pit or to a sewer system.

9.5.1. Safe Disposal of Human Excreta

Safe disposal

Include septic tank with soak pit, single leach pit, double leach pit, closed drain with sewer system and
closed pit.

Sample: All household with toilet (84590)

Almost all the households across both the village category, practiced safe disposal of excreta. All household
(100%) in ODF villages were reported to have practiced safe disposal which safe disposal practice in Non-ODF
household represents 99.1 percent.

There are only few states at an overall level which were reported to have safe disposal practice in less than 99
percent households. These states are Madhya Pradesh (98.9%), Jharkhand (98.5%), Meghalaya (98%) and Assam
(97.6%). All households in ODF villages were universally found to have practiced safe disposal of excreta except
the states like Andhra Pradesh & Madhya Pradesh (99.9% each) and Assam (99.8%). The percent distribution of
the households belonging to the Non-ODF villages of the states which shows safe disposal in less than 98 percent,
are West Bengal (97.6%), Assam (97%) and Meghalaya (96.1%). The different mechanisms of safe disposal
practices were described in the following figure. (Refer HH:9 in annexure table).

9.5.2. Hygienic situation of toilets

The survey also tried to look at the hygienic condition of the toilets across the rural households of different village
categories. Toilets were considered in hygienic condition based on set of criteria. The criteria were i) whether
the toilet was connected to a tank/pit or to a sewer system, ii) availability of fly proof seal (Water
trap/lid/other) in the toilet and iii) presence of no visible human excreta in the squatting area.

Based on the above criteria, the households which have toilets in hygienic condition at the national level
represents 95 percent. Hygienic condition of the toilet constitutes 99.5 percent of the ODF households while

CHAPTER-9: AVAILABILITY AND STATUS OF TOILETS IN HOUSEHOLDS

90.5 percent in Non-ODF households. At an overall level, states of Kerala, Gujarat and Haryana universally
reported to have hygienic household toilet while the states which have hygienic toilet in less than 90 percent
households are Goa (85.9%), Odisha (85.5%) and Jharkhand (84.4%). In ODF households, the state which
reported lowest percentage of hygienic toilet, is Jnarkhand which account to be 94.1 percent. In Non-ODF village
category, the states which shows the hygienic toilet in less than 90 percent households, are Uttar Pradesh
(89.9%), Goa (85.9%), West Bengal (85.2%), Odisha (83.1%), Maharashtra (82.4%), Karnataka (82.1%) and

9.5.3. Disposal of Children excreta by the household with children < 3 years

Safe disposal of child faeces
Include Put into the toilet & Buried in the ground

Sample: All household with children aged less than 3 years (13988)

Among the surveyed households (N=92411), 15.14% of the households having children aged less than 3 years
(n=13988) were asked about the disposal method for the faeces of the child. Based on the open-ended response
it was categorized whether the methods were safe way of disposing the faeces or unsafe method. The
respondents whose response recorded that, i) they put the faeces into the toilet or ii) buried it in the ground,
were considered as safe method of disposing the child’s excreta.

At the national level, almost all the household of ODF villages (95.4%) with children in the age-group of less than
3 years, disposed of the child excreta through safe method. The household of Non-ODF village represents only
59.9% which claims to have disposed of the child faces through safe methods.

State-wise analysis shows that the household of ODF villages where safe disposal of child excreta was reported
below 90 percent, were found in the states like Tamilnadu (86.8%), Assam (80.8%), Jharkhand (79.2%) and Bihar
(58%).

The states wherein less than 50 percent of Non-ODF households were practicing safe disposal of child faeces are,
Karnataka (45.6%), Jharkhand (44.2%), Bihar (41.4%), West Bengal (37.6%) and Odisha (27.1%).

9.6. | USAGE OF TOILETS
Using toilet always
Besides the accessibility to the toilet facilities, some usage characteristics of the household members were

explored through the set of questions to explore whether the family members used toilet always or there is an
irregularity in usage. The household members who gave response that they use toilet always, were further
probed to understand the extent of use of household toilet. And the question posed was, whether they used
toilet mostly, rarely or never in the last 15 days.

The age group-wise toilet use has been presented in the following figure which exhibits that the individual in
age- group of 55- 64 years always used the household toilet represents 98.6 percent followed by the individual
in age group of 65 or more which constitutes 98.3 percent.

Individual in the age-group of 45-54 years associated with the ODF household and using the toilet always
reported to be 99.9 percent which is highest across the different age-group. The individual in the age-group of
55- 64 years who belongs to the Non-ODF household and using the toilet always constitutes 97.4 percent across
the different age-group. (Refer table:11).

At the national level, the individuals were asked about the usage pattern of household toilet by providing some

more liberty if the individual using the toilet always. The respondent if answered that they did not always use
toilet, another follow-up question was asked if they use toilet often, rarely and never in last 15 days. The pattern
of usage of toilet by the individual who either responded always using toilet or they responded that not using
toilet always by often using it, put together and analysed. The data shows that majority of the individual falling
under the age-group of 55- 64 years who either always or often use the household toilet represent 98.8 percent
which is followed by 45-54 years of individual who constitutes 98.6 percent. The member of the household in
the age-group of 45-54 years and 55-64 years reported to be 99.9 percent each. In Non-ODF household, the
individual in the age-group of 55-64 years reported to be 97.7 percent who use household toilet always and
often. (Refer table:11)

9.7. SOLID AND LIQUID WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
9.7.1. Disposal of solid waste by the households

Safe disposal of Solid waste
Include Safely disposed within the household & disposed outside to the common system

Sample: All household (92411)

n definitional terms, solid and liquid waste management (SLWM) is the collection, transport, processing,
recycling or disposal of waste materials, usually produced by human activity, to reduce their effect on human
health or local aesthetics or amenity3. Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) is one of the key
components of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-G), launched with the objective of bringing improvement in
cleanliness, hygiene and the general quality of life in rural areas. SLWM is the collection, transportation,
processing, recycling, treatment, and disposal of waste material in a scientific manner.4

To investigate the SLWM practices by households, it was observed whether any garbage or litter was piled up or
stagnant water within 10 feet around the premises of the household. The observation was done along with
capturing GPS enabled photographs. To make the process of categorisation unambiguous, following definition
was used to identify the waste. Litter would mean — solid waste (examples of solid waste include wastes from
kitchens, gardens, cattle sheds, agriculture, and materials such as metal, paper, plastic, cloth, and so on). They
are organic and inorganic materials with no remaining economic value to the owner produced by homes. It will
not include properly stored garbage in covered bins for disposal, properly collected cattle dung within the
premises of the house for agricultural and other uses.

The households across the village category were asked about the visibility of the garbage or litter within the
premises of the house. The national level data shows that 97.5 percent households did not report to have visible
garbage or litter within the premises which is 98.6 percent in ODF village while 96.5 percent in Non-ODF village.
(Refer HH:11 of annexure table)

The surveyed household were also enquired about the process they followed to dispose of the solid waste. The
responses were categorized as i) Indiscriminate (absence of formal arrangement) ii) Safely disposed within the
household iii) Disposed Outside to common system.

At national level, more than half of the households (53.3%) reported to have disposed of the waste outside to
common system and 42.5 percent reported that the waste was safely disposed within the household and around

4.2 percent reported that disposal as Indiscriminate (there is no formal arrangement). The household of the ODF
villages majorly rely on one of the safe methods of solid waste disposal which is outside to the common system.
This method represents 49.7 percent while another method of safe disposal (Safely disposed within the
household) of solid waste which is the second most common method constitutes 45.4 percent.

Both method of solid waste disposal by ODF households shares almost 50 percent of the total household
practicing these methods. In Non-ODF households, the majority of the households rely on disposal practice by
dispose outside to the common system. (Refer HH:12 of annexure table)

By making the classification of safe and unsafe method of solid waste, the different safe methods were put
together to understand the safe method practice in better way. Thus, the total number of households at national
level which adopted the safe practice represents 95.8 percent. It is to be noted that comparatively higher number
of households (96.4 percent) of Non-ODF villages practiced safe disposal of solid waste than ODF households
(95.1 percent). (Refer HH:13 of annexure table)

Safe disposal of liquid waste
Include flows into a common system, kitchen garden & soak pit

Sample: All household (92411)

To understand the disposal pattern of the waste water in the households, the premise of the household was
observed against presence of stagnant water. Apart from observing the stagnant water, the disposal methods
were also asked. The various methods of disposal of liquid waste were classified as i) Indiscriminate ii) Flows in
common system iii) Kitchen garden and iv) Soak Pit.

During survey, the household respondents were first asked if there is any visible stagnant water within the
premises of the house. The data analysis shows that in overall, 96.3 percent household did not report any visible
stagnant water within the premises of the house. The household of the ODF village reported to be 96 percent
while Non-ODF household accounted to be 96.5 percent. (Refer HH:14 of annexure table)

The households were further probed about the different method of disposing of the waste water which they
practice. To which, the majority of the household (60.1%) responded to have practiced one of the safe methods
of disposal of waste water at national level. The same method of disposal of waste water gives highest
representation across ODF and Non-ODF household also, however, the proportion of this method is slightly
higher (63.2%) in Non-ODF.

State-wise analysis shows that the method of disposal of waste water through flows into a common system
majorly used in Haryana (99.3%) and Punjab (96.6%) which is more than 90 percent at national level. The
household of all other states which practices the same method represents less than 90 percent. The states of
Meghalaya and Nagaland primarily practiced the disposal of waste water in Kitchen garden which are accounts
to be 86.2 percent 71.2 percent respectively. Meghalaya is the only state herein the households practiced the
disposal through Kitchen garden across ODF and Non-ODF village which accounts to be 80.6 percent and 91.8
percent respectively. (Refer HH:15 of annexure table)

In India, there are few states wherein the households of the ODF villages have comparatively lowest percentage
in safe disposal of liquid waste. These states are Chhattisgarh (85.9%) followed by Madhya Pradesh (85.3%),
Karnataka (75.7%) and ANI (74.8%). Other states represent more than 90 percent. The states wherein the

10.1. INTRODUCTION

chools are common place for children to interact and learn about hygiene. Availability of toilets in
S schools are very important component of school’s infrastructure. Non-availability of toilets in schools
and that children practicing open defecation may lead to many health hazards like diarrhoea besides
resulting in drop-out from school, particularly among girls.
This chapter provides information about the availability of toilets by gender, number of toilet seats available,
number of toilets functional, functionality & hygienic status of the toilet, usage status, access to water and
availability of hand washing facility.
In each sampled village where school was available, the interviewer interviewed the eligible respondent of the
school to collect the data. In case if more than one school was found in the village, the same information fed into
the CAPI which eventually provided random selection of the school wherein the interview took place. Besides,
interviewing the respondent for collecting sanitation related data, some observation-based information was also
collected.
Among the surveyed villages (n=6136), 97.8 percent villages (n=6002) have got schools. Out of the schools found
in the village, 98.9 percent schools (n=5936) have got access to the toilet facilities and that out of the total toilets

10.2. Types and categories of the schools

10.2.1. Categories

For detailed discussion on extent of availability and status of the various components of the school toilet
pertaining to sanitation, the schools were further divided into three categories i) Boys schools ii) Girls schools
and iii) Co-educational schools. At the national level, 96.6 percent of schools were found to be co-educational.
In the same category, availability of boy’s school is slightly higher (1.8%) as compared to the girls’ school (1.6%).
Across both village category of the states, the trend of availability of boys’ and girls’ schools is same, however,
the percentage of availability of both boys’ and girls’ schools is slightly higher in schools found in ODF villages. In
ODF villages, the percentage of girls’ school is 1.9 and boys’ school is 2.1. In Non-ODF villages, the boys’ and girls’
schools are accounted to be 1.6 and 1.4 percent respectively.

11.1. INTRODUCTION

nganwadi centers (AWCs) were opened to execute the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)
Aw for children aged below 6 years. Pre-school education and mid-day meal are two major activities
apart from other health activities under the scheme. Infrastructural development of AWCs includes provision of
toilets for children at the centers.
This chapter provides the information about the availability, accessibility and functionality of toilets, hygiene and
sanitation practices followed in AWCs. Among the total surveyed villages (n=6136), 99.1% of the villages (n=6082)
were found to have AWCs. Of the total 6082 AWCs, 5550 AWCs were reported to have access to the toilet
facilities. Out of 4548 AWCs with toilet access, total 4482 were found unlocked and the survey happened in these
AWCs for data collection.

toilet, school toilet or community toilet for defecation. All these cases will be considered as AWC with toilet access.
This number will be used for calculating accessibility only. Q10 refers to the children visit to the places for
defecation if AWC does not have access to toilet.

* Other calculation will be based on this number only.

# The entire analysis will be based on the sample of AWCs (n=4482) with unlocked toilet unless otherwise
specified.

11.2. OWNERSHIP STATUS

Of the total AWCs (N=6082), the ownership status of AWC was checked by asking whether the AWC was running
in its own building or was running in a private building or house. The survey data revealed that at national level,
about three-fourth (70.5%) of the Anganwadi Centers were running in their own building. This percentage was
comparatively higher in the ODF villages (76.1%) than in non-ODF villages (65.4%). In Mizoram & Tripura, all
AWCs are running in their own building. The states wherein ownership represents more than 90 percent but less
than 100 percent are, Gujarat (98.5%), Nagaland (98.1%), Tamilnadu (96.7%), Karnataka (92.5%), Chhattisgarh &
Sikkim (92.3% each), Maharashtra (91.4%) and Kerala (91%). Ownership status with the center running in own
building represents 10.3 percent in Jammu & Kashmir which is lowest among other states at an overall level.

In ODF village category, there are few states where majority of AWCs are running in private building or house.

These states are J&K (84%), Himachal Pradesh (72.2%), Manipur (72%), Uttarakhand (67.2%), Punjab (66.7%) and
Bihar (61.3%). Please refer annexure table-AWC:1 for additional information.

The NARSS survey explored the places where the children can go for defecation in case the Anganwadi Centers
did not have access to the toilet. The survey findings indicated that at the national level, 25.2 percent of those
AWCs which do not have access to the toilet (n=1534), reported that children preferred to use either own house
toilet or nearby public toilets or school toilets in case of non-availability of toilets in Anganwadi Centers. The
children of About one-third of AWCs (34.7%) go for open defecation.

Under ODF village category, the children of 7.4 percent of the AWCs reported to go for open defecation while in
non-ODF villages, 45.5 percent of the AWCs were reported open defecation practices. Majority of the Anganwadi
Centers in ODF villages were reported to be “using own house toilets” (57.1%) followed by “school toilet” (30.9%)
and “nearby public toilet” (4.6%).

In non-ODF villages, 44.8 percent of the surveyed Anganwadi Centers reported to be relied on “Own house”
(35.9%), “School Toilet” (17.5%) or “Nearby Public Toilet” (1.2%) for the defecation.

Across all the states, the survey revealed that open defecation practices adopted by the children were very high
in Non-ODF villages (45.5%) as compared to the ODF villages (7.4%). Please refer annexure table-AWC:6 for

12.1. INTRODUCTION

ommunity toilets are an effective alternative for improving sanitation coverage among the densely
C populated low-income communities. Besides meeting the requirements of landless, a community toilet
also has the advantage of being able to serve the floating population in public places such as markets, bus stands,
railway stations, hospitals, places of worship etc. Community toilets are mainly of two types: ‘pay and use’ and
‘no-pay and use’.
This chapter gives information about the functionality, availability of water and sanitary condition of community
toilets in rural India and states.

Particulars Total ODF Non-ODF
Total number of villages surveyed 6136 2891 3245
Total number of villages with Public toilets* 1091 585 506
Total number of unlocked public toilets** 981 583 398
Total number of locked public toilets 110 2 108

ublic places are the area or location where large number of people gather and use the facility. These places
P.. in the number of people using them, the amount of time that people spent there increase the
likelihood of sanitation of the places become compromised. This chapter describes the current level of incidence
of fecal matter in the places which were historically used for open defecation, number of public places and
instances of open defecation, practices of safe disposal of solid waste, methods of disposal of waste water, public
places with minimal level of littering and minimal level of water logging. The data gathered pertaining to these
aspects was aimed to understand the current trend of sanitation practices adopted in the villages. The

13.7. METHODS OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL

Solid waste has potentially harmful health effects, if it is not disposed of properly. Exposure to the decomposed
waste may lead to develop various infective diseases and that the children are potentially more susceptible to
contract the disease than any adult individual. The survey captured the different methods of solid waste disposal
which were prevalent in the village. Under the different disposal methods, the options were provided in the
questionnaire which helped interviewers to record the correct methods wherever the methods were used in the
village. The options were: 1) No treatment of solid waste 2) Open burning of the solid waste 3) Waste dumped
in river/ water bodies 4) Community level composting arrangement (NADEP/ Vermi-composting etc.) in the
village 5) Community level waste collection arrangements and 6) Segregated waste collected, and safely
managed in the village.

Safe solid waste disposal methods

Includes Community level composting arrangement (NADEP/ Vermi-composting etc., Community level waste
collection arrangements & Segregated waste collected and safely managed in the village.
